# RTOS-Based-System-Monitor
Designed and implemented a system monitoring tool using FreeRTOS to track task states, CPU load, and stack usage in real time. Developed multiple tasks to simulate workloads and reported resource usage via UART, showcasing deep understanding of task scheduling, real-time constraints, and embedded system diagnostics.
